The web3 movement is one about creating a value layer for the internet where we can setup incentive structures for the betterment of society in order to make a fairer world where access to products and services is openly distributed, permissionless and accessible to everyone on the planet no matter their provenance.

There are many good initiatives like [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [GreenPill](https://greenpill.party/) and many others that try to help educate about and fund the new wave of public goods and infrastructure in order to create a better world. As a blockchain developer, it is good to get a feeling for why these systems are built out in the first place and the values the products and services we create embody so as to not recreate the  centralized web2 world we currently have.

In order to learn more about web3 values and how we can create a fairer world, go over [Kernel's web3 lessons](https://kernel.community/en/learn/)
