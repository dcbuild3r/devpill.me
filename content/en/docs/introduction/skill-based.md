There are different sets of skills required for different specializations, the technology stack and knowledge needed are determined by the layer and application that you want to target as a developer. I believe that everyone should get a solid general foundation and try out different areas and niches before settling on the main stack they want to focus on. Some people choose specializations according to the end goal that they want to accomplish using blockchain-based technologies, others like myself feel like everything is interesting and can't settle on a single one to specialize in when confronted with an analysis paralysis situation.

This guide will cover these main tracks, however anyone is free to submit a pull-request to add more or expand on the already existing ones:
