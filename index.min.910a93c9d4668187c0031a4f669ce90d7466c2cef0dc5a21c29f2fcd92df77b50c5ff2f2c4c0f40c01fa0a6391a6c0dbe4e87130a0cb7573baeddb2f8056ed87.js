Of course, this differentiation doesn\u0026rsquo;t encompass all types of development on blockchains, but it is a good way to get started.\nBy blockchain infrastructure, people usually mean client implementations of blockchain protocols that nodes or validators run to keep the chains running. These clients are usually focused on distributed ledger technology, networking, virtual machines, and various other low-level types of engineering. The client is what enforces the rules of the blockchain protocol, runs the consensus mechanism, that executes all transactions in the network and makes sure all nodes are in sync, and more. This is also known as core blockchain development, which is not what most devs picture when thinking about blockchain or web3 development in general. There are various niches within blockchain development itself as well; you can focus on improving execution capabilities with technologies like rollups, validiums, or volitions, you can improve decentralization and security guarantees by innovating on the consensus layer of the protocol, etc.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also blockchain infrastructure that supports the application layer by providing APIs to access blockchain data like oracles for smart contracts, indexing services for back ends, libraries that allow you to call and listen to smart contract events, decentralized storage services, and more.\nThe most popular type of blockchain development is on top of the application layer. Building decentralized applications (Dapps) can take many different forms, but it usually involves a smart contract and a user interface that interacts with that smart contract and listens to changes in the state of the blockchain. These applications can serve various use cases and can be used to build decentralized financial services, games, and so much more.\nThere are also applications that aggregate data from different smart contracts, transactions, and events on the blockchain to provide useful insight, these apps are mostly centered around data analysis and are not necessarily decentralized, but require an understanding of the underlying blockchain-based technologies.\nIf these concepts are completely foreign to you I suggest reading the how to get started section first, or Google the words you may not understand.\n"}).add({id:12,href:"/docs/security-engineer/",title:"Security engineer",description:"How to audit the security of various smart contracts, mechanisms and protocols.

If the contents of the previous block change, the hash changes as well and thanks to this feature we can assure that the data hasn\u0026rsquo;t been tampered with. The second consequence of the blockchain data structure is that it is append-only. You can\u0026rsquo;t prepend data to it, nor modify the data already within it, as that would alter the hashes of all the blocks succeeding the ones that have been modified. This is why we call blockchains immutable.\nA blockchain (network) is a network of computers that have a synchronized ledger of transactions that uses the blockchain (data structure) for storing data (usually inside of merkle/verkle trees). The blockchain is powered by miners/validators which operate under a so-called consensus algorithm, this algorithm helps coordinate who produces and organizes blocks as well as indicating which is the longest chain, by updating the head of the blockchain continuously. Blockchains have 3 main properties which they try to optimize for; Security, Decentralization, and Scalability. They achieve security and decentralization through their consensus algorithm where many different parties need to either provide resources mostly in the form of running expensive operations on massive hardware facilities with Proof-of-Work (PoW) or by staking economic resources in the network with Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The more participants and the more distributed the power dynamics among those participants, the more security and decentralization. There are many other features that contribute to decentralization, like client software which is able to be run on consumer hardware so that anyone can synchronize the state of the blockchain in their nodes, minimizing how many transactions you can process per block so as to not make the state of it too big and much more.\n Further reading  In order to understand how blockchains work beyond my simple explanation here read and watch the following resources:\n Blockchain Explained - Investopedia Blockchain 101 - Anders Brownworth But how does Bitcoin actually work? - 3Blue1Brown Optional (cultural significance): Bitcoin whitepaper  "}).add({id:28,href:"/docs/get-started/ethereum/",title:"Ethereum",description:"What is Ethereum and how does it work?",content:"Since this is a guide about blockchain development on Ethereum, it is required to know how the Ethereum blockchain works, and the changes that it will undergo in the future so as to be prepared for what\u0026rsquo;s to come as a developer.

WASM), a new engine (V8), etc\u0026hellip; The Ethereum blockchain is constantly evolving and quite a few changes will be put in place in the future before the core technologies of the network will start to ossify.\nA good way to get started with how Ethereum works is to watch Austin Griffith\u0026rsquo;s ETH.BUILD YouTube playlist where he illustrates how various parts of the Ethereum blockchain work.\n\u0026ldquo;In the Ethereum universe, there is a single, canonical computer (called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM) whose state everyone on the Ethereum network agrees on. Everyone who participates in the Ethereum network (every Ethereum node) keeps a copy of the state of this computer. Additionally, any participant can broadcast a request for this computer to perform arbitrary computation. Whenever such a request is broadcast, other participants on the network verify, validate, and carry out (\u0026ldquo;execute\u0026rdquo;) the computation. This execution causes a state change in the EVM, which is committed and propagated throughout the entire network.\u0026rdquo; (source: ethereum.org documentation)\nIn order to learn the basics of Ethereum, go through the ethereum.org documentation.

It\u0026rsquo;s a piece of code that has functions and data (state) which resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.\nSmart contracts are a type of Ethereum account meaning that they have a balance and can send transactions over the network. They are deployed on the network and run as programmed, user accounts (externally-owned accounts, or EOAs) can interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that interact with functions that are publicly accessible. Smart contracts can be used to define rules which are enforced via code, e.g. a smart contract that allows for two parties to swap their tokens (like Uniswap).\nHow do I create a smart contract? # The most popular smart contract programming language which targets the Ethereum virtual machine is Solidity. It is a high-level language that was influenced by C++, Python, and Javascript and so its syntax looks familiar. Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, user-defined types, and more. Solidity is a compiled language, which means that before having a runnable smart contract, a Solidity program needs to be run through a compiler that generates a low-level interpretation which is called bytecode. Bytecode are instructions that the EVM can understand and execute.\nThere are other languages that can be used to target the EVM like Vyper and Fe that have their pros and cons, however, they don\u0026rsquo;t have as robust development ecosystems and aren\u0026rsquo;t as widely used by projects deployed in production.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how a simple counter program would look like in Solidity:\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.10; contract Counter { uint public count; // Function to get the current count function get() public view returns (uint) { return count; } // Function to increment count by 1 function inc() public { count += 1; } // Function to decrement count by 1 function dec() public { count -= 1; } }  In the beginning, you declare the version of Solidity you are using the pragma solidity + version keyword. To indicate the creation of a contract you write it using the contract ContractName {} form. Within the contract curly brackets, the logic of the program is declared. We then declare a simple variable with the name count with unsigned integer type (meaning it can only hold positive integers). Afterward, we declare three different functions, one to retrieve the value held inside of the count variable, one to increase the variable\u0026rsquo;s value by one, and the last one to decrement its value. The public keyword specifies that the function can be called by any address on the blockchain (be it a smart contract or a user-owned account). The view modifier specifies that the function doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter the state within the contract (it only reads values already available). The returns keyword is used to specify the type of the object that is returned back by the function, unsigned integer type in the case of the get() function. Everything which is written after a // is considered a comment and is ignored by the Solidity compiler. Comments are used to make the code more readable and manageable, which is especially helpful if you are working with teams or revisit a codebase after some time. It also acts as documentation for what the code it is doing.\nHow do I compile and deploy my first contract? # In order to compile and deploy our first smart contract, we will use the Remix IDE which is a website where we can write smart contracts, compile them and deploy them on a local instance of the EVM. We can also interact with the local deployed smart contract to test out its functionality. To deploy our simple counter contract, go to Remix, add a new file in the contracts directory, name it Counter.sol, and copy-paste the code in the counter example. Now click on the second icon from the top in the selection bar on the left, it is the logo of the Solidity programming language and it symbolizes the Solidity compiler in Remix. In the compiler dropdown select 0.8.10 which is the Solidity version in our smart contract and click \u0026ldquo;Compile Counter.sol\u0026rdquo;. After you have compiled your contract click on the third icon from the top, it should have the \u0026ldquo;Deploy \u0026amp; Run Transactions\u0026rdquo; name. Click \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo;. After you have deployed, you should see a list item with \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt; COUNTER AT 0x\u0026hellip;. (MEMORY). You\u0026rsquo;ve successfully compiled and deployed your first smart contract! Now that you have it deployed, you can interact with it by calling the inc() or dec() functions to increase or decrease the value of the count variable. You can call the get() function to retrieve the value of the count variable.\n   We will go into a lot more depth on how smart contracts are programmed, tested, and deployed in the smart contract development section.\n"}).add({id:30,href:"/docs/get-started/web2/",title:"Web 2.0",description:"Web 2.0 technologies relevant in blockchain development",content:"Although blockchain developers build decentralized applications, the technologies used to build these applications overlap to a big extent. User interfaces for Dapps are hosted on the internet and are built with traditional web technologies. In order to interact with a smart contract, a user needs to submit a request to a server that hosts an application and that application needs to create a transaction, get the signature from a user via a web3 wallet like Metamask, and then submit the transaction to an Ethereum RPC. The transaction then goes to the mempool, gets picked up by a miner (PoW) / validator (PoS), gets executed and included in the blockchain, and the user interface updates once the blockchain emits an event with a successful call of a function inside of a smart contract. This is the usual flow that decentralized applications have.\nAny blockchain developer that wants to build full-stack applications needs to know how the internet and its most important protocols work as well as how to build user interfaces for all the major platforms (web, mobile, etc). You can think of web3 as adding a native value layer to the internet, it also helps with social coordination and resource allocation with the decentralized autonomous organization structure. It is very helpful to know how the web and the existing technologies built on top of it work and understand how crypto and web3 work in order to create better applications.\nI believe that even though you might not work with developing front-ends it is still good to know how they work on a foundational level as in almost all kinds of development you\u0026rsquo;ll interface with the web in some form. A good learning roadmap for the basics of how web technologies work is the roadmap.sh frontend initial steps in the roadmap.

These big centralized entities have a lot of power and control over our daily lives through the products we use each and every day.

To remedy this feeling, I suggest you look at programming on blockchains like an adventure game. You can explore what is possible, experiment by creating small projects with technologies that you find interesting, looking at what other people are building and interacting with their applications, debate with various people about their favorite applications, technologies and get a feel for how everything works.\nAs you progress through this guide, you\u0026rsquo;ll start going deeper into various different fields. There is a myriad of interesting primitives in web3 and types of applications you could build and so to pick what to specialize in from the get-go is very hard unless you have a clear goal in mind from the get-go which is quite rare. I personally think that trying everything that interests you if at least for a short while can get you a glimpse into that field and give you insight on whether you\u0026rsquo;d like to focus on that particular area. For this I suggest getting into different developer and research groups and talking about how is it like building those things, what are the types of problems you would be working on, how does one get better in that field, what is there to work on, etc. One of my favorite such groups is Newt which is Aave\u0026rsquo;s experimentation branch. Newt is completely community-driven and tries to promote open-source experimentation where the community is welcome to contribute to existing experiments or create their own. Here you can meet like-minded developers, build cool projects, explore different areas of development and different fields within web3 such as DeFi, NFTs, and more.

There are people all across the world learning how to build cool projects with these technologies and everyone is looking to learn from each other and make friends in the space. As mentioned before, join DAOs and groups like Newt, DeveloperDAO, EthernautDAO, etc, talk about your learning journey on Twitter and try to provide insight into your experience with learning these technologies. You\u0026rsquo;re bound to find like-minded individuals with whom you can share your interests, it helps a lot with learning the material as when you have to explain a complex topic to a person without former knowledge, it forces you to understand your subject very well in order to explain it simply. Pair-programming or pair-learning is also a good way to cement new learnings. Personally, I found that making friends online that are also into blockchain development is what made it the most fun and engaging for me and is helping me stick with the material for longer periods of time than I otherwise would have.\nTwitter is currently the platform where most builders, researchers, and creators share their insights in the realm of blockchain and web3, so it is almost a must if you want to keep up with the newest technologies. I also recommend to not overdoing social media as it can lead to a drastic decrease in productivity. It\u0026rsquo;s a balance that needs to be achieved over time, a good tip is that whenever you want to check Twitter or Discord you have a clear goal in mind, e.g. goal: I want to learn what new gas optimizations have my friends come up with? I also recommend creating lists with different types of people so you can sort by the type of content you want to see (DeFi, NFTs, MEV, smart contracts, frontend, design, etc). Bookmarking is also a good feature if you want to revisit interesting tweets in the future.\nAnother great way to meet devs is to go to hackathons and conferences. If you can afford to go to events then definitely do, however, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough funds there are oftentimes grants for first-time attendees through places like PadawanDAO, and others. Usually asking around to volunteer will get you a free entrance and people are usually kind enough to pool funds to sponsor people looking to get into the space that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the means to afford to travel by themselves. In-person events like hackathons are a great way to develop your skills and meet people. It\u0026rsquo;s where many projects that are popular today were started and the place where founders of projects usually meet for the first time. As for events worth going to in 2022, I suggest Devconnect (Amsterdam), ETHPrague, ETHCC/ETHParis and Devcon (Bogota). Here is a good list with Ethereum-related events in 2022, there are also events on pretty much every continent and there are also small local events that different communities organize, so look for events near you that might be related to blockchain development in some way or start one yourself!\nI also recently started creating a Twitter list with blockchain devs that I think you should follow if you want to learn blockchain development. It is a running list so feel free to DM me devs I should add and I\u0026rsquo;ll consider adding them to the list.\n"}).add({id:35,href:"/docs/get-started/build/",title:"Build",description:"Code, fail, get up, try again, learn, improve, repeat",content:"The next and final step to get started with blockchain development should be obvious by now, it is to actually start building!

If you are not sure which one you\u0026rsquo;re into yet, just go with full-stack blockchain development and you\u0026rsquo;ll get to try a bit of everything! Start writing code, no matter how bad it is, and try to get feedback on it from devs that know more than you do. Go through the roadmap that I have specified below, learn a concept, take notes, build something around it, do some testing and move on. If there is something that catches your attention, then try building something with it and see where it takes you. Your own curiosity and interest are your best friend when learning blockchain development. You should constantly ask yourself why did the thing that I wrote worked and how I could make it better, if you can\u0026rsquo;t come up with an answer you either ask someone for an explanation or for a code review. It is also good to review quality code written by other teams. If you are learning Solidity, for example, the best way to learn advanced Solidity is to read into production codebases like Aave v3, Uniswap v3, Balancer v2, etc. The same principle applies to other categories and specializations as well.\nOnce you build something, share it with the world (unless it\u0026rsquo;s a very profitable MEV bot)! Sharing it on Twitter and different Discords will bring attention to what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and you might get constructive feedback and/or meet new friends that are interested in what you are building. If you are building something more complex, try creating documentation for it or make some useful comments if you expect other people to read your code. It is also great to share code and make it publicly available on hosting platforms like GitHub to build a portfolio of projects which you can showcase in order to show other people when applying for job positions.

Most of the technology stack blockchain developers use to build user interfaces for their applications overlaps with the traditional web-development infrastructure and so there are is a mature ecosystem of languages, libraries, and APIs you can make use of as a developer to make your life much easier as well as a vast community of developers which maintain codebases, provide support through platforms like StackOverflow and create very well produced tutorials and documentations for learning these established technologies, something which isn\u0026rsquo;t the norm in rapidly emerging and constantly evolving web3 technologies.\nThe key principles of front-development require knowing how to structure and style websites, how to make them dynamic with JavaScript and different frameworks, how to manage state within applications, basic design, how to fetch data from APIs and databases, and how to create good web3 user experiences regarding wallets and the interactions with the smart contract backend of your application. One of the biggest differences in web3 FE development is user-authentication as instead of logging in with your email and password or your Google account, you log in with your wallet using a third-party application like Metamask or WalletConnect and protocols like ENS to display information about the user (provided they have an Ethereum domain). If a smart contract contains a state which represents past interactions with the application by the user, you also need to fetch historical data from the blockchain on-demand or maintain a local database with indexed data which is easily queriable by the FE of the application.\nAs a front-end blockchain developer you need to know what a Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) is in order to be able to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain or on an L2 like Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, or ZkSync which are Ethereum-based scaling solutions that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover in the L2 section. You also need to query data from various APIs to accurately display the price of various assets (if applicable), the user\u0026rsquo;s balance of ERC20 tokens or NFTs, and various other data you might need from either the blockchain itself or an external database.\nAnother interesting feature of programming decentralized applications is the need for building applications that are not hosted on a centralized server, to remedy this problem many developers have their web interfaces open-sourced and have many instances of those interfaces on decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, Arweave, and others. In this way, if one of the servers hosting the interface to interact with the smart contracts goes down, users can interact with it from many other different places. It\u0026rsquo;s also amazing that since the functions are able to be called by anyone, users can interact with decentralized applications from completely different frontends as long as they have the ABI, this allows for massive composability which we\u0026rsquo;ll cover a bit later.\nThis roadmap will focus on the frontend technologies that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen are mostly used in blockchain development today. I\u0026rsquo;ve used the roadmap.sh frontend roadmap, a friend\u0026rsquo;s tech stack, and my experience as a reference for creating this specialization.

CSS is a styling language that helps you edit how your HTML elements look, how they are displayed and how they are arranged on your screen. It is also what makes user interfaces responsive for different devices like mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, and others by providing APIs which dynamically resize your HTML elements based on the width and height of the screen a specific user has. JavaScript is a programming language that makes your HTML elements dynamic, it allows for things like complex animations, dynamic formatting of elements depending on given inputs, state management within your application, much more utility thanks to its programmability, and more. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the only 3 technologies that browsers understand, the rest of the technologies mentioned in this specialization end up compiling to an optimized HTML, CSS, and JS bundle which the browser can process and interpret.\nThe best place to learn the basics of web development in my opinion is freeCodeCamp where you can do the lessons in the first two sections named \u0026ldquo;Responsive Web Design\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures\u0026rdquo;. It says that each section takes about 300 hours each, but usually, you can do it in much less since it\u0026rsquo;s a conservative estimate. After you\u0026rsquo;ve gone through these two sections and made the initial projects that are required to fulfill them you can move on to learning React. Another great place to learn is the Mozilla developer documentation where you can learn everything about HTML, CSS, JS, Web APIs and their specifications, protocols like HTTP and other web technologies.\n"}).add({id:39,href:"/docs/front-end-development/react/",title:"React",description:"What is React.js and how to build UIs using it.",content:"In modern web development, you\u0026rsquo;ll almost never write vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your websites. Web developers learn a view framework that helps them to better structure their code with components and also optimize the way in which components are rendered and how changes to the state of the application affect what the users see. The most popular web development framework is React with a wide margin compared to Vue.js. React was originally developed by the Facebook team, but was open-sourced early on and now it has thousands of contributors and many full-time maintainers who are constantly pushing the framework forward.\nMost of the user interfaces for blockchain applications are programmed using React and there are many React component libraries that you can reuse from the community to perform common tasks like logging with an Ethereum wallet, switching networks, and also so-called React hooks libraries (i.e. eth-hooks) which let you fetch different data like balance, block number, prices and more.\nI believe that React is best learned from the official documentation, but there are also other resources for people that learn better with video content. Here is a list of React learning resources that I recommend:\n React in 100 Seconds - Fireship React roadmap Official React documentation awesome-react - This GitHub repository aggregates many useful resources for React developers, it has tutorials, tooling, component libraries, frameworks, design patterns, guidelines, and much more. It is a good place to look for inspiration and resources when using React. If you want a paid video course I can recommend either ZTM\u0026rsquo;s React course or Maximilian Schwarzmuller\u0026rsquo;s React course. On Udemy there are sales periods every once in a while which allow you to buy courses for $15 instead of $200, so wait for one of those, never buy for the full price. freeCodeCamp React course on YT  After you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ve understood how React works, you have learned about lifecycle methods, hooks, how to pass down data through props, how to use the Context API, etc. I recommend trying to build the front end of a web3 app like Uniswap or an NFT marketplace like OpenSea. To rapidly prototype the design I recommend using tailwind.css and Chrome browser developer tooling to inspect the styles of the site you\u0026rsquo;re trying to recreate. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use CSS flexbox/grid where necessary.

This means that you declare the types of variables (integer, string, \u0026hellip;). It allows for a better developer experience as the Typescript compiler can catch many errors ahead of time since it checks the types of the objects ahead of time. It also allows developers to tap into extra features on top of JavaScript which allows writing more expressive JavaScript. Remember that Typescript cannot be run by the browser and needs a compiler to convert TypeScript code into runnable JavaScript. Typescript is widely used by the web-development community thanks to its features that improve security, readability, allow for a better development experience inside of the IDE with autocompletion, and add cool new syntactic sugar on top of JavaScript.\nI recommend going to the Typescript documentation, it is good to get into the habit of going to official documentation since they are usually the right place to visit if you are learning new technology.

An example of this is Uniswap\u0026rsquo;s AMM. In order to call the swap function in the smart contracts, you need to know how many tokens you will get back with an X amount of ETH that you put into the contract. In order to display the current price of any asset, your application will either query data from the blockchain directly or it will use an indexing service that has that data already available. These APIs are very useful and are a critical part of any application.\nTheGraph # A very popular service is TheGraph. TheGraph is a decentralized indexing protocol that allows you to query networks like Ethereum, the protocol has an incentive layer that rewards indexers to create APIs for the data you specify. Developers can create so-called subgraphs, which are data APIs that make the data easily accessible through a GraphQL schema. GraphQL is a querying language that is used as an alternative to traditional REST APIs. GraphQL schemas are harder to set up initially, but in turn, they enjoy massive scalability. In order to learn more, check out their documentation. To learn how GraphQL works checkout the official documentation, HowToGraphQL and this YouTube playlist (although it may be a bit outdated by now, better check the documentation).\nNodes # One of the most common ways to query data from the blockchain is by calling RPC endpoints of nodes that are syncing the full-state of the blockchain. A node runs the Ethereum blockchain, has all of its state, and syncs periodically every single time a new block appears. You can run your own node on consumer hardware, but it is unscalable if you want to use those nodes for querying data for massive applications as you\u0026rsquo;d need to build your own DevOps pipelines in order to scale to your needs accordingly. That\u0026rsquo;s why most developers use a third-party node provider like Alchemy or Infura. You can call these APIs by using web3 libraries like ethers.js, web3.js or myriad others.

It also has smart contract alerts, cloud functions, cross-chain user authentication, and more. The only downside of using Moralis is that it\u0026rsquo;s a centralized service provider. It is the easiest way to get a backend for your Dapp going as Moralis has a very simple to use SDK that helps you tap into the APIs offered by their services.

Smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain have functions that can be called externally by any other account on Ethereum, be it an externally owned account (EOA = user wallet) or another smart contract. Many of these functions require certain parameters to be fed into them, they also rely oftentimes on an external state like prices of tokens on the blockchain, balances of the user\u0026rsquo;s wallet, and more. Ethers.js is what allows a user interface to call these functions, users can input certain information in the frontend of your application and that information can be put into the function call of the smart contract, after the transaction is broadcasted the EVM will try to execute that function call and if every check inside of the function doesn\u0026rsquo;t give out any errors it will execute, otherwise, the transaction will revert.\nEthers.js is currently the most popular Ethereum library among developers, but there are alternatives like web3.js, web3.py, Brownie, and many others.

This is a short section on different tooling you\u0026rsquo;ll find yourself using regularly.\nPackage management # If you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten this far in the front-end specialization you\u0026rsquo;ve certainly had to install packages like React, Next.js, tailwind.css, ethers.js, and many others. The most popular package managers in the JavaScript ecosystem are npm and yarn. Package managers allow you to keep track of which versions of which external code libraries your application uses as well as how the project\u0026rsquo;s code is structured, how to run different tests, how to run your program, and various other miscellaneous tasks.\nAs you build more complex applications it is good to learn the depths of your package manager, how to structure package.json files, how to write scripts that automate the boring stuff, how to set up a CI/CD pipeline (we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this in a bit), and more.\n Package management basics npm yarn  Styling / Animation # There are many CSS libraries and frameworks which modify the way in which you write CSS.

When you\u0026rsquo;re writing code, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to miss a space, a tab, a colon, an opening or closing bracket, or to write code with bad and inconsistent styling. That\u0026rsquo;s where linters and formatters will come in handy as they automate the task, they can be configured to run on saving and on commit, so that badly styled code never gets into production or into a public repo. The most popular choices are:\n Eslint Prettier  CI/CD # CI/CD stands for continuous integration / continuous deployment, they are a set of tools that allow you to create automatic processes that execute whenever a change is made to the codebase usually hosted on the cloud so that the production servers running your application get automatically updated with the newly pushed code. These actions can also modify and run tests on the code before it gets pushed into production, if tests fail the commit or update will not go through and collaborators will get notified of this. Once projects become bigger and they have big teams of contributors a solid CI/CD pipeline is very important so as to maximize the security and correctness of code being pushed into production. Examples of popular CI/CD tooling are:\n GitHub Actions CircleCi Husky  Testing # A key part of development is mitigating how many bugs are inside of your application. To ensure that the code behaves as it is intended to we write unit tests, integration tests or even end-to-end tests. Each kind of test focuses on a different part of the application lifecycle. Modern tooling like Cypress allows you to simulate all possible states of your application and simulate user flows, you can even record user session tests as if you were recording a real user going through your website. In web3 you will also be doing integration tests for smart contract interaction. You can test smart contracts using libraries like Foundry, Hardhat or Truffle. Most of these tests will be written by a smart contract or full-stack developer, however, as a frontend developer, you need to test how the interactions with the contracts will influence the flow of the user interface of your application. You can write various tests in JavaScript with ethers.js and couple it with Cypress to write complex tests. The web3 app development lifecycle usually goes from locally deployed smart contracts and front-end, to testnets (live network environment but with non-valuable assets), and to mainnet (not necessarily Ethereum mainnet, it can be an L2 like Arbitrum, a sidechain like Polygon PoS, etc). On the smart contract, side development teams hire external security auditors to verify that the contracts are secure to use, we will cover this in-depth in the smart contract development section.\n Cypress Jest Mocha  ENS integration # ENS domains are human-readable domains for Ethereum addresses, the registrar for these domains is fully on-chain and the protocol is decentralizaed and governed by a DAO. ENS domains serve as an on-chain identity mechanism which many Ethereum users use to express themselves on-chain and to display information about themselves through ENS profile metadata containing contact information like email, Twitter, Discord or links to websites, a profile picture (NFT image metadata) and more. As a web3 front end developer you can tap into this registrar and display users' information once they\u0026rsquo;ve connected to your application with their web3 wallet.\nThe best way to get started with ENS is their official documentation, here you can get a general understanding of the ENS protocol.

To write contracts you need to learn the programming languages that are able to compile to a target that the virtual machine can understand. In the case of the Ethereum blockchain, we have the EVM which has a set of operations it supports (a.k.a OPCODES). The most popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum is Solidity, which is a statically typed, object-oriented high-level programming language that takes inspiration from C++, Python, and JavaScript. With Solidity, you can program logic that executes inside of the EVM and the result of its operations is stored on the blockchain forever. The state of these applications is easily accessible from a full-node or from a third-party data indexing platform. The goal of smart contract developers is to create secure applications which perform a certain action, for example, a contract that allows for users to swap tokens, to buy and sell NFTs, to vote on proposals, etc.\nThere are many different stages in the smart contract development stage, from experimentation, iteration, testing, auditing, testnet deployment, and mainnet deployments. There are also different sets of best practices that developers and production teams adopt in order to mitigate the security and economic risk of their applications. Another important part of writing smart contracts on Ethereum or Ethereum L2s is optimizing the contracts to minimize the amount of gas they consume. Since block space on Ethereum and L2s is limited, there needs to be a fee mechanism in order to avoid state bloat that gives a fixed gas price to each operation executed by the respective VM. That means that the more complex a smart contract is, the more expensive it will be to deploy and for the users to use. There are various design patterns that optimize the code to consume the least amount of gas possible, whilst remaining readable and secure.\n"}).add({id:56,href:"/docs/smart-contract-development/solidity/",title:"Solidity",description:"How to write smart contracts in Solidity?",content:"Solidity is by far the most popular language to write smart contracts at the moment as the EVM is the most widely adopted virtual machine out there. Not only is it used in Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s execution layer, but many alt L1s and L2s on Ethereum use the EVM as their virtual machine since there\u0026rsquo;s a fairly mature development ecosystem. In order to first learn Solidity, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over a few simple courses that explain the principles of the language, and as we progress further we will talk about design patterns, testing, security, oracles, and more.\nCryptoZombies is an interactive web application that teaches you the basics of Solidity through a fun development game. It teaches you how to create a contract, the data types that Solidity supports, how to write methods, how to manage objects, events, inheritance, memory management, interfaces, modifiers, and more. By the time you finish the first three short courses, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to read and write Solidity code. An alternative to CryptoZombies which is in video form is the Solidity playlist from Smart Contract Programmer on YouTube. This one is a bit better as it covers Solidity 0.8.0 which is a fairly recent version. Also go through the Solidity-by-example smart contracts which teach you the basics of Solidity, some common security vulnerabilities and the implementations of some popular patterns.\nAfter we finish the course with the basics, we\u0026rsquo;ll move on to building small projects implementing various different protocols, applications, and cryptographic primitives through the use of the scaffold-eth challenge that appear in this thread. Scaffold-eth is a web3 development template built by Austin Griffith and open-source contributors which abstracts the backend of your app and creates a front-end interface for interacting with the smart contracts that you write. We will start with the Ethereum Speed Run challenges in the thread mentioned above, and continue with building more complex applications like a signature-based multisig, an app that uploads images to IPFS, and more.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve been writing more and more complex smart contracts it is a good idea to start looking at other people\u0026rsquo;s code to get a feel for how they implement different features, how they structure code, what designs and patterns they use, how they optimize for gas, and a lot more.\nThere are many techniques that you\u0026rsquo;ll be picking up along on your journey in order to make your contracts more resource-effective and gas-optimized so that your users don\u0026rsquo;t need to spend as much money for using your applications.\nA good example of well-made smart contracts at the intermediate level are Miguel Piedrafita\u0026rsquo;s lil-web3 contracts. They are simple implementations of popular protocols and applications. They also have tests attached to them which are written using Foundry, which we will cover shortly. Take a look at how comments are written, how events and errors are used, how it is structured, gas minimization techniques he employs, try to understand the design of the protocol implementation, etc. Trying to implement your own versions of well-known applications and protocols is a great way to improve at Solidity as you\u0026rsquo;ll learn a lot about the development process that you\u0026rsquo;ll go through once you are writing production code at a company or DAO.\nThreads that talk about getting really good at Solidity #  Tips from Emilio Frangella @ Aave Tips from @freddycoen Tips for non-beginners from @0xCacti Tips from @transmissions11 Tips from @Zer0dots  Once you\u0026rsquo;ve gone through all of the above the best you can do to learn Advanced Solidity is to see what the best codebases look like.

Many different libraries are used by different teams, there are pros and cons to using each different library and in some cases, they can be used in a complementary fashion. We will cover the most popular ones among top-tier developers as well as the most commonly used ones like HardHat and Truffle.\nOpinionated recommendations: Foundry for testing and Hardhat for deployments\nFoundry # Foundry is the hottest library in the Ethereum development landscape, it is originally built by Georgios Konstantopoulos who is one of the most highly respected developers in the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Georgios is currently the CTO at Paradigm and part of his job is building tools for developers that will be used to create the applications of the future.\nFoundry is composed of two parts: Forge and Cast.\n Forge: Forge is a fast and flexible Ethereum testing framework, inspired by Dapptools. Cast: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.  The library is written in Rust, which is a systems-level programming language that has memory safety, borrow checking, performant concurrency, and many other features which are making it one of the favorite languages used by developers across all fronts. Many popular libraries are being written in Rust, popular compiler targets like WASM are supported by Rust, a lot of Ethereum developer tooling is built using Rust or is refactoring their infrastructure to use Rust. It is a very exciting trend in blockchain development and many developers are learning the language to be able to contribute to these cool pieces of software. The best way to get started with Rust is The Rust Book and the Rustlings repo.\nThe reason why Foundry is getting a lot of popularity and it is so important, is because Solidity tests should be written in Solidity and not in JavaScript. It is very hard to master two different languages at once and Solidity developers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be forced to learn it in order to be able to test their smart contracts. Foundry is also getting an increasingly superior development environment in terms of features. The main features for which you might use other toolkits are mainly deployment which is not supported by Foundry so far. For managing deployments, the standard toolkit is HardHat. For testing, gas optimization features, fuzzing, symbolic execution (hevm), etc, do use Foundry. Good resources for learning and mastering Foundry are:\n The Foundry Book - Community sourced documentation Tweet from @andreasbigger:  Familiarize yourself w/ Forge-cli Checkout some templates:  FrankieIsLost forge template ZeframLou forge template AndreasBigger femplate   Dive into repos using Foundry:  lil-web3 n3rp zen cloaks ethernaut-x-foundry damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry Multicall   Brockelmore\u0026rsquo;s testing verbosity with forge-std    HardHat # Hardhat is the Ethereum development library that’s the most widely used across the ecosystem and is the standard in most production codebases like Aave, Uniswap, and many others. Usually, all the deploy scripts, migration files, automation scripts, etc are written using Hardhat and their tooling suite. It is a javascript library (that has Typescript support). Recently the Hardhat team announced that they are moving their infrastructure to Rust as most of the tooling ecosystem is moving to use it do its performance and security.\nDapptools # Dapptools is a suite of Ethereum focused CLI tools following the Unix design philosophy, favoring composability, configurability, and extensibility.\nThere are 4 key elements in Dapptools:\n dapp - All you need Ethereum development tool. Build, test, fuzz, formally verify, debug \u0026amp; deploy solidity contracts. seth - Ethereum CLI. Query contracts, send transactions, follow logs, slice \u0026amp; dice data. hevm - Testing-oriented EVM implementation. Debug, fuzz, or symbolically execute code against local or mainnet state. ethsign - Sign Ethereum transactions from a local Keystore or hardware wallet.  A cool innovation done by app tools was the hEVM which is an EVM implementation written in Haskell (a functional programming language) that allows to symbolically execute Solidity code and formally verify the results of the resulting bytecode (opcode operations). This feature was later adopted by Foundry, including many others that were first provided by Dapptools.\nTruffle Suite # Truffle Suite is a suite of tools developed by Consensys to locally test smart contracts by deploying them on a local instance of the Ethereum blockchain, mocking user addresses using the Ganache library, writing tests using Truffle, and creating on-chain data pipelines for user interfaces using Drizzle. It was one of the first complete Ethereum developer tooling ecosystems that were released, but they’ve fallen out of favor in recent years as libraries like Hardhat overtook it.\n"}).add({id:59,href:"/docs/smart-contract-development/design-patterns/",title:"Design patterns",description:"Modern Solidity application design patterns",content:"Once you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with writing more and more complex contracts and maybe taking a look at the front-end code and it interacts with the smart contracts, you\u0026rsquo;ll start getting a feel for how smart contracts are designed from a more high-level view. There are certain designs and patterns which are commonplace, things like the approved pattern for tokens, and more. At this point, it is a good idea to start thinking more about the overall architecture of your code and the structure that it will take to efficiently implement the functionality you want to enable.\nThere are common patterns employed in smart contract development, this Solidty-patterns repo implements some of them.\nSince the EVM is such a constrained environment where each additional operation executed by the EVM adds gas costs to the execution of the smart contract, developers try to build as least resource-intensive contracts as possible whilst also maximizing readability and security. Since blockchains are a very adversarial environment were mistakes in a smart contract could lead to fund drains (RUGS) and exploits, it can be considered mission-critical software and so many developers get inspiration from other mission-critical software guidelines like the ones of NASA which are responsible for the lives of astronauts going to space. These development principles are guidelines that help optimize a codebase for maximum security through the adoption of a standardized procedure and developer mindset.\nENS integration # We mentioned how to integrate ENS domain names into your dapp within the front end development section, but as a smart contract developer you can also resolve ENS domain names on-chain, write your own resolver which implements EIP137 or even write your own registrar.\n"}).add({id:60,href:"/docs/smart-contract-development/specialized-languages/",title:"Specialized languages",description:"Languages to write lower lever EVM compatible bytecode",content:"There are various programming languages that can be compiled into EVM bytecode, there are high-level programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper, or Fe, but there\u0026rsquo;s also an intermediate programming language that\u0026rsquo;s often used within gas-optimized contracts called Yul, or as a developer, you can write EVM assembly by writing the EVM opcodes directly. A common technique for gas minimization is writing Solidity code looking at the resulting EVM assembly code and comparing the gas cost of different implementations in order to make the contract as gas-efficient as possible.\nYul # Yul is an intermediate-level programming language that can compile into EVM bytecode. From the Solidity documentation:\n\u0026ldquo;The design of Yul tries to achieve several goals:\n  Programs written in Yul should be readable, even if the code is generated by a compiler from Solidity or another high-level language.\n  Control flow should be easy to understand to help in manual inspection, formal verification, and optimization.\n  The translation from Yul to bytecode should be as straightforward as possible.\n  Yul should be suitable for whole-program optimization.\n  In order to achieve the first and second goals, Yul provides high-level constructs like for loops, if and switch statements and function calls. These should be sufficient for adequately representing the control flow for assembly programs. Therefore, no explicit statements for SWAP, DUP, JUMPDEST, JUMP and JUMPI are provided, because the first two obfuscate the data flow and the last two obfuscate control flow. Furthermore, functional statements of the form mul(add(x, y), 7) are preferred over pure opcode statements like 7 y x add mul because, in the first form, it is much easier to see which operand is used for which opcode.\u0026rdquo;\nEVM Assembly # EVM Assembly can be written inside of inline Solidity statements with the assembly keyword. It allows for more fine-grained control over the resulting bytecode. Oftentimes the compiler is unable to optimize Solidity code well and so it results in unnecessary gas costs.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also an unchecked keyword in Solidity which disables the overflow and underflow checks from the compiler which were introduced in Solidity 0.8.0 and before were part of the SafeMath library in OpenZeppelin libraries. The unchecked keyword is oftentimes used.\nWriting Yul or inline assembly can obfuscate the functionality of your code by making it less readable for other contributors/auditors and it can potentially introduce new risks as the Solidity compiler oftentimes performs various optimizations and security checks.\nGood toolkits for writing EVM Assembly:\n etk huffc and the afforementioned Yul intermediate language  "}).add({id:61,href:"/docs/smart-contract-development/evm-deep-dive/",title:"EVM deep dive",description:"Learn about the inner workings of the EVM.",content:"Understanding the ins and outs of the EVM is crucial for building highly optimized applications as each operation executed by the EVM has a gas cost attached to it and users have to pay the price for executing functions within the applications that they use. There is a compromise between readability and code optimizations however, which needs to be taken into consideration. Sometimes using techniques like bitshifting and bitmapping (Hacker\u0026rsquo;s Delight is a good book that talks about bit manipulation techniques in detail) can have a negative impact on readability and thus security, as other contributors and auditors may not be able to wrap their heads around these complex optimizations or it would simply take too much time for them to do so. For code that actually goes into production, each project needs to asses how much do they want to optimize their code for gas savings over readability. Security usually comes first, however there are still a set of well-known good practices that will allow you to save some gas. If you end up using gas optimization techniques it is also advised to document them well with comments inside of your Solidity contracts. Another important point is that as these technologies scale and developers are less constrained by the virtual machine executing smart contract bytecode, the needs for optimizations becomes less important along with the fact that the compilers converting static code to machine code are getting better and better at optimizing code for performance and low costs. As technologies like L2s and data availability layers become mainstream we also may see an emergence of new VM architectures that experiment with new designs that do not require developers to work with low-level optimizations as they will be highly performant and scalable.\nFor a comprehensive EVM deepdive, I suggest these resources:\n EVM development starter kit Read Chapter 13 (EVM) of The Ethereum Book Read Femboy Capital\u0026rsquo;s Playdate with the EVM Go over OpenZeppelin\u0026rsquo;s series on Deconstructing smart contracts Read Analyzing smart contracts by Elvira Albert (very math heavy) Read over TakeNobu\u0026rsquo;s slides on how the EVM works (visualized) Go over design patterns section Go over the exemplary good codebases at the beginning of the Solidity section Follow gas optimizoors like @transmission11 for gas alpha Get used to going to lookup gas costs for different OPCODE operations at EVM Codes Check out the EVM execution specs Learn to use Foundry well Bonus resources in comments of this Twitter thread  Special thanks to @0x_doggie and @freddycoen from whose threads I extrapolated these resources.\n Thread 1 Thread 2  You might wanna go through Nick\u0026rsquo;s Posts and Jean\u0026rsquo;s Solidity articles\n"}).add({id:62,href:"/docs/full-stack-development/introduction/",title:"Introduction",description:"What is full-stack blockchain development and how to get started",content:"As the name implies, full-stack blockchain development is the closest specialization to being a jack of all trades.

There are various structures in web3 that allow a developer to get paid for their work, some of them are:\n working for a company that is building a web3 product setting up a grant through Gitcoin Getting bounties by working for DAOs find vulnerabilities in applications, protocols and contracts for security bounties through platforms like ImmuneFi being a DAO core contributor and getting paid with bounties  The easiest way to find a job is being active in the social platforms of the projects you\u0026rsquo;d like to be hired at or contribute to, e.g. if you want to become a smart contract developer at Uniswap, then talk to the team on Discord, suggest them new features, implement mockups, apply for a grant and if you are good enough someone will notice and try to hire you to work on it full-time within the DAO itself or for Uniswap Labs which is the core team leading the smart contract development efforts. The most important thing is to show initiative, being proactive and openly talking about helping. If you come across something interesting also don\u0026rsquo;t forget to post it on Twitter or on Telegram.\nIn order to find interesting projects to work for, web3 devs look at Twitter as it\u0026rsquo;s the place where everything unfolds and where every single project lives. If you build out a reputation as a good blockchain developer, then you\u0026rsquo;ll start getting DMs from interesting people and projects as there is an extreme lack of talent in the space and insatiable demand for good developers.\n"}).add({id:77,href:"/docs/getting-a-job/portfolio/",title:"Porfolio",description:"How to create a portfolio of relevant projects in the blockchain space",content:"In order to become a good job candidate, it is almost imperative to have a portfolio of projects that you\u0026rsquo;ve built in order to showcase the skills you have, the technologies you use and your thought processes behind solving different problems. I.e. if you are interested in building DeFi applications then you can showcase that by writing a demo of an AMM, a yield aggregator, a money market, etc. The more high quality demo projects you have the better as these will act as valuable information for teams looking to hire. The most popular way to showcase your projects is to publish them publicly on GitHub.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what to build you can look at different problems different projects are facing, try solving one of them and publishing the solution as a public repo on GitHub. You can build demo projects from sites like SpeedRunEthereum using templates like scaffold-eth, and much more.\n"}).add({id:78,href:"/docs/getting-a-job/job-boards/",title:"Job boards",description:"The most popular aggregators of open job positions in crypto and web3",content:"The two most used platforms to find crypto/web3 jobs are Twitter and a few select job boards.

As most of the web3/crypto culture resides on Twitter, it is a natural place for developers, founders, creators and users to hangout together. The more value you provide to the community, the more following you\u0026rsquo;ll get, therefore the more outreach as a developer. All teams are thirsty for good developers and so the more relevant followers you have, the more chances you\u0026rsquo;ll get of being discovered by a team looking to hire a blockchain developer in your field of expertise. Building up your Twitter reputation can propel you forwards more than you\u0026rsquo;d expect, a lot of friendships, partnerships and collaborations have been initiated through Twitter and it is currently the place to account for social value (clout) in the space.\nIf you manage to demonstrate mastery of any given skill within web3, then you are guaranteed a position pretty much anywhere as all teams are looking for talent. If you are just starting out, but you show a strong drive and initiative to learn then many teams will ask to take you under their wing in order to upscale your skills by getting your hands dirty and learning while building as you go. By being active on relevant social platforms like Twitter, Discord and Telegram and socializing with the right people, finding a job becomes relatively easy as everyone is looking to hire talent.\n"}).add({id:80,href:"/docs/coming-soon/",title:"Coming soon",description:"Coming soon",content:"This section is in the process of planning by popular demand.
